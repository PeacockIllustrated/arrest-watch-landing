**Customer Access & Targeting Map** 

**We Combine Targeted Sales With Credibility-Led Marketing**

ArrestDelta is sold into environments where **trust, risk, and defensibility** matter. Our access strategy therefore combines:

* **Founder-led and relationship-assisted sales**, and  
* **Authority-driven marketing** that creates inbound interest, shortens sales cycles, and de-risks buyer decisions.

Marketing is not used to create volume, it is used to **establish legitimacy before the first meeting**.

**Marketing’s Role in the Access Strategy**

Marketing is deliberately narrow and senior-focused.

**What Marketing Does**

* Establish ArrestDelta as a **credible new category**  
* Educate buyers *before* sales conversations  
* Provide champions with material to sell internally  
* Reduce perceived risk for Legal and Compliance

**What Marketing Does NOT Do**

* High-volume lead generation  
* Generic content  
* Performance advertising  
* SDR-driven outbound

---

**Core Marketing Assets (Year 1\)**

* Flagship whitepaper:

  **“Why arrest monitoring fails at scale and how enterprises fix it”**

* Executive briefs for:  
  * Trust & Safety  
  * Legal & Compliance  
* Thought leadership from founders and senior law enforcement leadership  
* Select event participation (Trust & Safety, Risk, Compliance)

These assets directly support enterprise sales, they are not standalone campaigns.

---

**Buying Triggers (How Marketing & Sales Intersect)**

Deals typically start when:

* Litigation & settlement figures get out of hand  
* A high-profile incident occurs  
* Legal reviews current processes  
* An audit exposes false-positive risk  
* Existing tools create alert fatigue

Marketing ensures that when these triggers occur, **ArrestDelta is already familiar**.

---

**Why This Scales**

* Early traction is relationship-assisted, not relationship-dependent  
* Marketing compounds credibility across multiple accounts simultaneously  
* Sales cycles shorten as ArrestDelta becomes a known reference point  
* Expansion occurs naturally as trust is established

---

**Investor Summary** 

*We reach our first 20 customers through targeted enterprise sales, supported by credibility-led marketing that reduces buyer risk and accelerates adoption, not through volume-driven demand generation.*
