**Customer Proof — Early Validation**

**We Do Not Claim Traction. We Demonstrate Truth.**

At this stage, our proof is not logos or contracts.

Our proof is **consistent buyer behaviour**, **repeatable problem validation**, and **clear alignment on what a viable solution must deliver**.

**What Enterprises Consistently Tell Us**

Across conversations with Trust & Safety, Public Safety, Security, and Compliance leaders, we repeatedly hear the same themes:

* “We don’t know when arrest records have actually changed.”  
* “False positives create more risk than missed events.”  
* “We spend too much time manually verifying updates.”  
* “We can’t defend acting on stale or inconsistent arrest data.”  
* “Our current tools surface refreshes, not meaningful change.”

These statements emerge independently, without prompting, across multiple organizations.

**What Buyers Say a Viable Solution Must Do**

Enterprises are remarkably aligned on solution requirements:

* Detect **meaningful change**, not raw data refreshes  
* Aggressively suppress noise and false positives  
* Provide **confidence and auditability**, not just alerts  
* Integrate into existing Trust & Safety and Security workflows  
* Reduce legal and operational risk, not introduce new exposure

This alignment confirms that the problem — and the solution shape — are well understood by the market.

**Evidence of Serious Engagement**

While we are early, engagement quality indicates real demand:

* Multiple deep discovery sessions completed with enterprise organizations  
* Follow-up technical and operational reviews involving cross-functional stakeholders  
* Active scoping discussions for **paid pilots**, including success criteria and governance  
* Engagements involving Trust & Safety, Security, and Legal stakeholders — not innovation teams

This is not casual interest; it is problem-driven engagement.

**What We Can Demonstrate Today**

We are already able to show tangible artifacts, including:

* Redacted examples of **verified arrest-change alerts**  
* Sample confidence scoring and audit trails  
* A defined pilot structure suitable for enterprise deployment  
* A clear differentiation between “data refresh” and “state change”

These artifacts allow buyers to assess feasibility and risk before committing.

**What Comes Next**

Our near-term validation milestones are explicit:

* Convert pilot discussions into **paid design partner engagements**  
* Validate signal quality and false-positive reduction in live environments  
* Establish 1–2 referenceable enterprise customers  
* Expand coverage and product scope based on real operational feedback

Customer proof will compound quickly once pilots begin.

**Investor Summary** 

*At pre-seed, our customer proof is not logos,  it is consistent enterprise validation of the problem, alignment on the solution requirements, and serious engagement toward paid pilots.*
