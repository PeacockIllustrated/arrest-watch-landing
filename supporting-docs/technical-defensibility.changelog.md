# Technical Defensibility Deck — Content Changelog

**Source:** `/supporting-docs/ArrestDelta - Technical Defensibility.md`
**Implementation:** `lib/technicalDefensibilityConfig.ts` & `pages/investor/TechnicalDefensibility.tsx`

This document tracks all changes made to the original source text during implementation.

---

## 1. Thesis Statement Formatting

*   **Original:** Plain paragraph text
*   **Overlay:** Key phrases highlighted with visual emphasis:
    - "real-world complexity compounds faster than competitors can copy" — styled in accent red
    - "operational learning, verification logic, and accumulated edge cases" — styled in white
*   **Reason:** **Clarity**. Visual hierarchy helps investors scan the core thesis quickly.

---

## 2. Investor Summary Punctuation

*   **Original:** `...arrest intelligence,  verified change detection...` (double space before "verified")
*   **Overlay:** `...arrest intelligence — verified change detection...` (em dash, single space)
*   **Reason:** **Clarity**. Corrected typographical artifact for cleaner presentation.

---

## 3. Section Eyebrows

*   **Original:** Section numbers only ("1.", "2.", etc.)
*   **Overlay:** Added descriptive eyebrows aligned with content themes:
    - "CORE BARRIER" for County-Level Variance
    - "STATE AWARENESS" for Change Detection
    - "COMPOUNDING ACCURACY" for Verification Logic
    - "HARDEST PROBLEM" for False Positives
    - "CROSS-CUSTOMER LEARNING" for Infrastructure
    - "BARRIER DEPTH" for Hard to Copy
    - "STRATEGIC DISCIPLINE" for Restraint
*   **Reason:** **Investor Readability**. Eyebrows provide scannable context without altering content.

---

## 4. "Arrest Delta" vs "ArrestDelta"

*   **Original:** Mixed usage ("Arrest Delta" and "ArrestDelta")
*   **Overlay:** Preserved original variations exactly as written
*   **Reason:** **Fidelity**. Did not normalize to avoid introducing changes.

---

## No Content Modifications Made

The following canonical elements were preserved **verbatim**:

- All section headlines
- All bullet point lists
- All callout statements
- Flywheel formula ("Coverage → learning → accuracy → trust → expansion")
- Competitor requirements list
- Investor summary statement

---

## Structural/Visual Adaptations

These are presentation-layer changes, not content modifications:

*   **Jurisdiction Variance Console:** Abstract grid tiles with hover-reveal labels (from canonical variance factors)
*   **Stateful Entity Timeline:** Toggle between "Rows" and "Transitions" views
*   **Verification Gate Pipeline:** Detect → Evaluate → Verify → Surface with hover criteria
*   **Noise Suppression Dial:** Toggle between "Coverage-first" and "Confidence-first"
*   **Defensibility Flywheel:** Animated circular visualization of canonical flywheel
*   **Copy Difficulty Checklist:** Reveal-on-click presentation for competitors' requirements
*   **Throttle Visual:** Illustrative bars showing expansion speed (low) vs confidence (high)
