**CANONICAL SOURCE**: `ArrestDelta - Founder - Investor Fit.md`  
**IMPLEMENTATION DATE**: 2026-01-09

## Overview

This document tracks all text modifications made during implementation of the Founder–Investor Fit investor deck page. Per requirements, only minimal overlay edits were permitted.

---

## Edits Applied

### 1. Eyebrow Labels (New — UI Structure)
**Purpose**: Slide-level section labels for navigation and visual hierarchy.

| Section | Added Eyebrow |
|---------|---------------|
| Thesis | `FOUNDER–INVESTOR FIT` |
| Looking For | `ALIGNMENT INDICATORS` |
| Not Optimized | `MISALIGNMENT INDICATORS` |
| Growth | `GROWTH PHILOSOPHY` |
| Partnership | `PARTNERSHIP TERMS` |
| Closing | `CLOSING THOUGHT` |

**Reason**: Consistency with other investor deck pages (Kill Criteria, Technical Defensibility). Eyebrows are UI labels, not content additions.

---

### 2. "Why This Matters" Tooltips (New — Interaction Layer)
**Purpose**: Provide context on hover for alignment items without adding to main content.

| Item | Tooltip Added |
|------|---------------|
| Enterprise understanding | "Our buyers navigate complex procurement cycles." |
| Accuracy unlocks scale | "In high-trust markets, reliability enables expansion." |
| Pilot-led adoption | "Enterprise deals require validation before commitment." |
| Strategy tradeoffs | "Decisions require nuanced understanding of constraints." |
| Long-term ambition | "Durable outcomes require sustained commitment." |
| Data integrity risk | "Eroding trust undermines the core value proposition." |
| Premature scope | "Premature expansion dilutes focus and increases risk." |
| Volume-driven GTM | "Low-quality adoption leads to churn and reputation damage." |
| Short-term valuation | "Optics-first approaches do not compound in high-trust markets." |

**Reason**: Interaction requirement (Alignment Console). Tooltips are paraphrased from canonical context, introducing no new claims.

---

### 3. Growth Gate Stage Labels (New — Interaction Layer)
**Purpose**: Visual gate interaction illustrating growth philosophy.

| Stage | Label |
|-------|-------|
| Stage 1 | "Pilot signal" |
| Stage 2 | "Reliability proven" |
| Stage 3 | "Scale expansion" |

**Reason**: Derived directly from canonical bullets. Illustrative only, no numbers.

---

### 4. Partnership Profile Badge (New — Derived)
**Before**: N/A  
**After**: `long-term / evidence-led / enterprise-native`

**Reason**: Derived from canonical language ("long-term partners", "grounded in evidence", "enterprise decision infrastructure"). Summarizes partnership stance without new claims.

---

## Content Preserved Verbatim

The following canonical content was preserved exactly as written:

- Thesis headline and key stance
- All 5 "Looking For" bullet points
- All 4 "Not Optimized For" bullet points
- All 4 growth philosophy bullets
- The conviction line: "In this market, accuracy scales faster than speed alone."
- All 4 partnership values with their descriptions
- Reciprocal commitment statement
- Complete closing thought (3 paragraphs)

---

## Edits NOT Made

- No new numbers, traction, or metrics added
- No customer names or logos added
- No external references added
- No guarantees or absolutist language introduced
- No changes to the core stance: reliability/accuracy as engine of scale
