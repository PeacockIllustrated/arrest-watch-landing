Example Decision Scenario \- Before & After ArrestDelta

**Subheading**

Reducing exposure without increasing false positives

---

**Scenario Description**

An individual in a trust-critical workforce role passes a background check at onboarding and is granted access.

Several weeks later, an arrest occurs in a county jurisdiction.

---

**WITHOUT ArrestDelta**

Background check completed at onboarding

No persistent identity reference maintained

Arrest appears first as a provisional booking record

Record is delayed, incomplete, or name-only

Discovery occurs via periodic refresh, third-party notification, media, or external inquiry

Internal teams rush to confirm identity and validity

Action is taken after exposure, under time pressure

Result

Reactive response, elevated false-positive risk, and limited auditability.

---

**WITH ArrestDelta**

Identity is resolved and anchored at onboarding, using multi-signal verification which may include biometric confirmation where legally permitted

ArrestDelta continuously monitors for state change

Provisional signals are detected but suppressed

Identity and state transition are verified first

Confidence threshold is met before alerting

Verified alert is routed with context and audit trail

Result

Measured response, reduced exposure window, and defensible decision-making.

---

**Key Shift**

From reacting to ambiguous events to acting on identity-confirmed change.

---

**Design Instructions for Tom**

Use a two-column vertical layout with equal visual weight.

Clear divider between Without ArrestDelta and With ArrestDelta.

Neutral icons only.

No mugshots, alarms, warning triangles, or emotional imagery.

Typography and spacing should match the investor page.

This page should feel like operational risk documentation, not marketing.

---

**Final Note for Tom**

These documents are intentionally conceptual.

They must not imply accuracy percentages, latency guarantees, or full production readiness.

The purpose is to demonstrate system logic and decision integrity.
