**Market Sizing**

**We Size the Market From Where We Can Actually Sell**

We do not start with abstract global TAM.

We size the market from **buyers who already make arrest-related decisions today**, have budget authority, and feel the cost of false positives and stale data.

Our approach is **serviceable-first, expandable-by-design**.

---

**Core Assumption**

ArrestDelta is sold as **enterprise decision infrastructure**, not a per-check commodity.

* Enterprise contracts  
* Multi-year potential  
* ACV expands with:  
  * Coverage  
  * Geography  
  * Additional “Delta” products  
  * Depth of workflow integration

---

**Serviceable Available Market (SAM – Near-Term)**

**Target Buyer Universe (Year 1–3)**

We focus initially on enterprises that:

* Make ongoing arrest-related decisions  
* Already spend on background checks, monitoring, or internal review  
* Face legal or reputational exposure from false positives

**Primary segments**

1. Gig & marketplace platforms  
2. Background screening providers (as customers/partners)  
3. Regulated enterprises with continuous risk review

**Estimated Buyer Count (Conservative)**

* \~1,000–1,500 enterprises globally meet these criteria  
* Initial geographic focus: United States

**Pricing Reality**

* Average enterprise ACV: **$150k–$250k**  
* Conservative midpoint used for sizing: **$175k**

**Near-Term SAM Calculation**

* 1,000 enterprises × $175k ACV

  → **$175M annual serviceable market**

This is the market we are actively selling into with ArrestDelta today.

---

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM – First 36 Months)**

We do not assume dominance.

**Conservative Capture Assumption**

* 2–3% penetration of SAM over 3 years

**SOM Range**

* 20–30 enterprise customers  
* $3.5M–$5.5M ARR

This aligns directly with our GTM plan and revenue model.

---

**Market Expansion Levers (Why This Gets Much Bigger)**

The long-term opportunity expands along **four orthogonal dimensions**.

**1\. Customer Expansion**

* More enterprises with Trust & Safety, Risk, or Compliance exposure  
* International expansion beyond the US

**2\. Product Expansion (“Delta Stack”)**

ArrestDelta is the first product.

Natural adjacencies:

* Custody status changes  
* Court outcomes  
* Charge disposition  
* Warrant activity  
* Expungements and corrections

Each expands ACV and wallet share.

---

**3\. Depth of Integration**

As ArrestDelta becomes embedded:

* Alerts become workflow triggers  
* Confidence scores inform automation  
* ACV grows with dependency

This supports **mid-six-figure and seven-figure contracts** over time.

---

**4\. Platform & Partner Distribution**

* Background screening providers  
* Risk platforms  
* Regulated service vendors

Distribution through partners increases reach without linear sales headcount.

---

**Total Addressable Opportunity (Directional, Not Inflated)**

We do not present a single “$XXB TAM” number.

However, when considering:

* Global enterprise buyers  
* Multiple Delta products  
* Deep workflow integration

The opportunity supports a **multi-billion-dollar outcome** if ArrestDelta becomes the standard layer for arrest-related change intelligence.

---

**Why This Is Venture-Scale**

* High ACV  
* Strong expansion dynamics  
* Infrastructure-level embedding  
* Durable customer relationships  
* Clear path from $1M → $10M → $100M ARR

This is not a volume business.

It is a **trust-and-decision business**, which historically supports large, defensible companies.

---

**Investor Summary (One Line)**

*We are targeting a conservative $175M serviceable market today, with clear expansion paths that support a multi-billion-dollar opportunity as ArrestDelta becomes embedded decision infrastructure.*
