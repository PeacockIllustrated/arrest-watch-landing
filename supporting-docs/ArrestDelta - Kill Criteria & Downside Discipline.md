**Kill Criteria & Downside Discipline**

**We Define Failure Conditions Upfront**

Arrest Delta operates in a high-stakes, enterprise environment where discipline matters. We believe strong companies are built by defining **what success looks like and what failure looks like before capital is fully deployed**.

We therefore define clear conditions under which we would **pause, materially change direction, or discontinue** the current approach.

This is not pessimism. It is risk management.

---

**Kill Criterion 1 \- Inability to Achieve Signal Confidence**

**Condition:**

If we cannot demonstrate, in live pilot environments, that ArrestDelta materially reduces false positives and delivers **decision-grade confidence** relative to existing processes within the first 6 months.

**Rationale:**

If verified change detection does not materially outperform current approaches, the core thesis does not hold.

**Action:**

We would halt GTM expansion and reassess:

* Event definitions  
* Verification logic  
* Product scope

If confidence cannot be achieved, we would not scale.

---

**Kill Criterion 2 \- Lack of Willingness to Pay**

**Condition:**

If enterprises validate the problem but are unwilling to engage in **paid pilots or early contracts** within 6–9 months.

**Rationale:**

Time investment without budget commitment indicates interest, not demand.

**Action:**

We would reassess:

* ICP focus  
* Pricing and packaging  
* Buyer persona alignment

We will not subsidize validation indefinitely.

---

**Kill Criterion 3 \- Non-Repeatable Sales Motion**

**Condition:**

If early enterprise deals prove to be **purely relationship-driven** and cannot be replicated beyond initial accounts.

**Rationale:**

A business that depends on unique personal relationships does not scale.

**Action:**

We would pause hiring and expansion, refine positioning, and validate whether the value proposition resonates independently of specific relationships.

---

**Kill Criterion 4 \- Sales Cycle Exceeds Enterprise Reality**

**Condition:**

If the average sales cycle consistently exceeds **9 months** without clear progress toward commitment.

**Rationale:**

Extended cycles indicate either insufficient urgency or misaligned value.

**Action:**

We would narrow scope further, target higher-urgency buyers, or repackage the offering.

---

**Kill Criterion 5 \- Regulatory or Legal Friction Is Structural**

**Condition:**

If legal, compliance, or regulatory stakeholders consistently block pilots despite technical and operational alignment.

**Rationale:**

If the product cannot be deployed defensibly, adoption will stall regardless of value.

**Action:**

We would reassess:

* Product framing  
* Delivery model  
* Market selection

We will not push against immovable institutional barriers.

---

**Capital Discipline Trigger**

If two or more kill criteria are met simultaneously, we will:

* Freeze non-essential spend  
* Halt headcount expansion  
* Reassess the core thesis with board and advisors  
* Determine whether to pivot, narrow, or wind down

This ensures capital is preserved and decisions are made deliberately.

---

**Investor Summary**

*We define failure conditions upfront because we are building enterprise decision infrastructure  and discipline is part of the product.*  
---

**Final Note**

These kill criteria are not expectations of failure. They are guardrails to ensure we only scale **when the core thesis is proven**.
