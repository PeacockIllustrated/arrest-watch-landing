**Use of Funds — Milestone-Based Plan**

**Capital Is a Tool to De-Risk the Business, Not to Fund Exploration**

We are raising this pre-seed round to achieve a **specific, measurable set of milestones** that materially de-risk Arrest Delta and position the company for a strong Series A.

We are not using this capital to “find product–market fit.”

We are using it to **prove it, harden it, and scale it responsibly**.

---

**Total Capital Raised**

* **$1.0m pre-seed investment**  
* Founder runway and core technical development already in place  
* Capital deployed with strict discipline across commercial, technical, and risk milestones

---

**Milestone 1 — Enterprise Validation (Months 0–4)**

**Objective:** Prove that enterprises will pay for Arrest Delta and deploy it in live environments.

**What This Unlocks**

* 1–2 paid design partner agreements  
* Clear pilot success criteria defined with enterprise buyers  
* Validation of pricing, scope, and procurement pathway

**Capital Deployed**

* Sales execution and travel  
* Legal review of pilot agreements  
* Limited marketing to support credibility (content, materials)

**Outcome:**

Paid pilots in production-adjacent environments with real accountability.

---

**Milestone 2 — Signal Quality & Trust (Months 3–6)**

**Objective:** Demonstrate that Arrest Delta materially reduces false positives and improves confidence in arrest-change detection.

**What This Unlocks**

* Live validation of verification logic  
* Evidence of reduced manual review and alert noise  
* Auditability suitable for Trust & Safety and Legal teams

**Capital Deployed**

* Infrastructure scaling  
* Data normalization and verification refinement  
* Security and compliance hardening

**Outcome:**

Proof that Arrest Delta delivers *decision-grade* intelligence, not raw data.

---

**Milestone 3 — Reference Customers & ARR (Months 6–9)**

**Objective:** Convert early pilots into long-term enterprise contracts and establish reference credibility.

**What This Unlocks**

* 3–4 enterprise customers under contract  
* $500k–$700k ARR  
* At least one referenceable customer

**Capital Deployed**

* Hiring of one enterprise account executive  
* Continued GTM execution  
* Customer success support

**Outcome:**

Repeatable enterprise sales motion with reference support.

---

**Milestone 4 — Scalable Growth Foundation (Months 9–12)**

**Objective:** Prepare the business for sustained growth and Series A readiness.

**What This Unlocks**

* 6 enterprise customers live  
* $1m+ ARR run rate  
* $3m+ qualified pipeline  
* Expansion path for additional “Delta” products

**Capital Deployed**

* GTM acceleration  
* Expanded jurisdiction coverage  
* Legal, compliance, and procurement readiness

**Outcome:**

A de-risked, enterprise-validated company ready for Series A.

**Capital Allocation Summary**

| Category  | Allocation |
| :---- | :---- |
| Sales & Marketing / GTM | $250k |
| Marketing & Authority Building | $150k |
| Legal & Compliance  | $75k |
| Cloud & Infrastructure  | $150k |
| Contingency & Runway Buffer | $200k |
| Flex / Optionality  | $175k |
| Total  | $1.0m |

We intentionally avoid over-investing in headcount or marketing until validation milestones are met.

**How We Measure Capital Efficiency**

We evaluate capital deployment against:

* Pilot-to-contract conversion  
* False-positive reduction metrics  
* Sales cycle duration  
* Reference readiness  
* Pipeline coverage (≥3:1)

Capital is only deployed further once milestones are met.

---

**Investor Summary (One Line)**

*This capital allows us to convert enterprise validation into repeatable revenue, prove signal quality at scale, and reach $1m+ ARR with reference customers, without premature scaling.*  
---

**Final Discipline Statement**

If we do not meet these milestones within the expected timeframe, we will **not** increase burn or scale prematurely. We will reassess scope, positioning, or focus before deploying additional capital.
