**Why Now \- Arrest Delta**

**The Problem Is Not New. The Risk Is.**

Arrest and booking data has always been fragmented, asynchronous, and inconsistent across jurisdictions. What has changed is **how much damage bad or stale arrest data now causes** and **how quickly that damage propagates** inside modern enterprises.

Enterprises today are no longer making isolated, manual decisions. They are operating **event-driven, automated, high-velocity systems** where arrest data influences:

* Trust & Safety actions  
* Marketplace access decisions  
* Compliance workflows  
* Legal exposure  
* Public and regulatory scrutiny

In this environment, **acting on incorrect or outdated arrest information is no longer a tolerable edge case, it is a systemic risk.**

---

**Regulatory and Legal Pressure Has Shifted the Equation**

Over the last several years, regulatory and legal expectations have changed materially:

* Greater scrutiny of automated and semi-automated decisions  
* Increased liability for wrongful deactivation or denial of access  
* Higher standards for explainability, auditability, and accuracy  
* Growing enforcement around data correctness and proportionality

Enterprises can no longer defend decisions by pointing to “data availability.”

They must demonstrate **data accuracy at the moment of action**.

---

**The Cost of False Positives Is Rising Faster Than the Cost of Missed Events**

Historically, organizations optimized for **coverage**, more data, more alerts.

Today, the dominant cost has shifted to:

* Wrongful action  
* Reversals and appeals  
* Legal challenges  
* Reputational harm  
* Regulatory inquiry

False positives now create **more downstream risk** than delayed awareness.

This makes **signal confidence** — not data volume — the critical variable.

**Public Records Are Getting Harder, Not Easier**

Public safety data is not converging into a clean, centralized system.

Instead:

* Jurisdictions remain fragmented  
* Update cycles are asynchronous  
* Corrections and expungements are increasing  
* Systems are modernizing unevenly  
* Scraping hostility is rising

As systems become more complex, **change detection becomes harder**, not easier.

This favors infrastructure built specifically for **state transitions**, not bulk ingestion.

**Enterprise Architecture Has Finally Caught Up**

What was not viable 5–10 years ago is now practical:

* Event-driven systems are standard  
* Webhooks and real-time pipelines are expected  
* Enterprises want signals, not dashboards  
* Automation requires deterministic inputs

Enterprises are now **ready to consume arrest data as verified events**, not static records.

---

**AI Has Raised the Stakes**

As more downstream decisions are automated or AI-assisted:

* Errors propagate faster  
* Decisions scale instantly  
* Liability compounds

Bad data no longer affects one case — it affects thousands.

This makes **verified change detection** foundational, not optional.

---

**Why Arrest Delta Exists Now**

Arrest Delta exists because:

* Enterprises are exposed to arrest data risk in ways they were not before  
* Existing tools surface data refreshes, not meaningful change  
* False positives now cost more than missed events  
* Enterprises are structurally ready for event-based intelligence

The problem has always existed.

**The consequences have finally caught up.**

**Board / Investor Summary** 

*Arrest Delta exists because modern enterprises can no longer afford to act on arrest data without knowing what has actually changed, and current systems were not built for that reality.*
