How verified change becomes a safe, actionable signal

**Intro Copy**

ArrestDelta sits between fragmented public records and enterprise decision systems.

Rather than surfacing raw events, the platform detects and verifies state change before any alert is issued.

The flow below illustrates how provisional signals are filtered, confirmed, and escalated only when confidence thresholds are met.

**Flow Steps**

1. Public Records Ingestion

   County and jurisdictional sources with variable structure, latency, and completeness.

2. Provisional Signal Detection

   Initial booking or custody events are detected but treated as provisional.

3. Identity Resolution

   Records are resolved against an established identity reference using multiple signals, which may include biometric confirmation where legally permitted, to eliminate ambiguity and false matches.

4. Verification Gate

   State transitions are confirmed and confidence thresholds applied. Noise and incomplete signals are suppressed.

5. Actionable Alert Routing

   Only verified, high-confidence changes are routed to Trust & Safety, Legal, or Security teams.

**Closing Line**

Verification occurs before alerts, not after.

**Design Instructions for Tom**

Layout should be a left-to-right horizontal flow.

Each step should be in a distinct box.

Step 4, Verification Gate, must be visually distinct using a thicker border, subtle color contrast, or gate/shield icon.

Do not use facial imagery, biometric icons, fingerprints, cameras, or timers.

Do not imply speed or real-time guarantees.

The diagram should feel like infrastructure, not a product UI.
