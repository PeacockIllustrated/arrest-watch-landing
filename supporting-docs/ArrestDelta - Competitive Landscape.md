**Competitive Landscape**

**The Market Has Moved Toward Timeliness \- Not Toward Decision Confidence**

The arrest-data ecosystem has evolved toward faster detection, but the hardest problem remains unsolved: **knowing whether an arrest record has meaningfully changed over time and whether that change is reliable enough to act on.**

ArrestDelta is built specifically to solve that gap.

---

**1\. Traditional Background Checks (Point-in-Time)**

**What they do**

* Establish an initial criminal history snapshot  
* Deeply embedded in onboarding and compliance workflows

**Structural limitation**

* Static by design  
* No visibility into post-check changes  
* Not suitable for continuous operational decisions

**Role in ecosystem**

* Necessary foundation  
* Insufficient for dynamic risk environments

**Main Players & Market Context**

* [**Checkr**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0) – private; widely estimated **$4B–$5B+ valuation**  
* [**HireRight**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1) – public; market cap historically **$1–2B**  
* [**Sterling**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=2) – public; acquired/private again; historically **$1–1.5B**  
* [**First Advantage**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=3) – public; market cap historically **$3–4B**

**Key Takeaway**

This is a **large, monetised, slow-moving market** optimised for checks, not change.

**2\. Continuous Monitoring & Near-Real-Time Arrest Detection**

Some incumbents now offer continuous or near-real-time arrest detection, including [**Checkr Continuous Checks**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=4).

**What these systems do well**

* Detect *new arrest events* faster  
* Use direct integrations and pointer searches  
* Verify record existence at the county level

**Structural limitations**

* Optimised for **event detection**, not ongoing record evolution  
* Arrests treated as discrete events, not stateful entities  
* Limited ability to distinguish:  
  * Material vs cosmetic changes  
  * Stable vs provisional updates  
* High downstream manual review burden  
* False positives accrue *after* the initial arrest

**Key Takeaway**

Frequency improves awareness, but **does not deliver decision-grade confidence**.

**Main Players & Market Context**

* [**Checkr**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=5) (via Continuous Checks) – part of a multi-billion-dollar platform  
* [**Certn**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=6) – private; estimated **$200–400M**  
* [**GoodHire**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=7) – private; estimated **$100–200M**

**Key Takeaway**

This segment validates demand, but remains **noise-heavy and operationally risky**.

---

**3\. Data Aggregators & Investigative Platforms**

**What they do**

* Aggregate public and proprietary records  
* Provide broad access to risk and investigative data

**Structural limitations**

* No native concept of state transitions  
* Minimal verification of *meaningful* change  
* Interpretation pushed entirely to customers

**Role in ecosystem**

* Access layer, not decision layer

**Main Players & Market Context**

* [**LexisNexis Risk**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=8) – part of RELX; implied business value **$10B+**  
* [**Thomson Reuters CLEAR**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=9) – part of TR; implied **multi-billion-dollar** segment  
* [**TransUnion**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=10) – public; market cap historically **$10–15B**

**Key Takeaway**

These companies are massive, but **they sell data access, not decision certainty**.

---

**4\. OSINT & Scraping-Based Platforms**

**What they do**

* Powerful investigative tooling  
* Flexible, analyst-driven workflows

**Structural limitations**

* Manual and operator-dependent  
* Not built for automated enterprise decisions  
* Not suitable for Trust & Safety workflows at scale

**Main Players & Market Context**

* [**Babel Street**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=11) – private; estimated **$500M–$1B**  
* [**ShadowDragon**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=12) – private; niche enterprise  
* [**Maltego**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=13) – private; smaller, investigator-focused

**Key Takeaway**

Strong tools, but **not infrastructure**.

---

**5\. Internal & Manual Systems (Hidden but Widespread)**

**What they do**

* Custom scripts  
* Analyst workflows  
* Manual county checks

**Structural limitations**

* Expensive, fragile, non-scalable  
* High human error  
* Significant compliance risk

**Market Context**

* Exists inside **nearly every large enterprise**  
* Represents **latent demand**, not a competitive threat

---

**Where ArrestDelta Is Fundamentally Different**

ArrestDelta does not compete on *speed alone*.

It delivers:

* **Stateful change modeling**, not event alerts  
* **Verification beyond record existence**  
* **Biometric identity resolution (facial recognition)** to reduce mis-attribution  
* **Confidence-weighted outputs**, not raw updates

This combination materially reduces false positives and enables **defensible action**.

---

**Why This Is a Standalone Company**

This layer persists because:

* Incumbents optimise for checks or access  
* Verification \+ identity resolution increases complexity and liability  
* Accuracy compounds with time, coverage, and learning

That makes ArrestDelta an **independent infrastructure layer**, not a feature.

---

**Investor Summary (One Line)**

*Multi-billion-dollar incumbents solve access and onboarding. ArrestDelta solves the unsolved layer: verified, identity-certain change detection enterprises can actually act on.*
