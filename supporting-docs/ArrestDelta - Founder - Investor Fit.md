**Founder–Investor Fit**

**How We Think About Building ArrestDelta**

ArrestDelta is being built as **enterprise decision infrastructure** in a regulated, high-stakes environment. The opportunity is large, the demand is real, and we are determined to build a **high-growth, category-defining business**.

At the same time, accuracy and trust are not constraints for us, they are the **engine of scale**. In our market, growth that compromises signal quality does not compound; it breaks.

This document is intended to clarify what partnership looks like for us.

**What We’re Looking For in an Investor**

We are looking for investors who are aligned with building a **fast-growing enterprise company where growth is earned through reliability**.

Specifically, we value partners who:

* Understand enterprise and regulated buying environments  
* Appreciate that **accuracy and defensibility unlock scale**, not limit it  
* Are comfortable with pilot-led adoption that converts into large, durable contracts  
* Can engage thoughtfully on strategy, tradeoffs, and sequencing  
* Share our ambition to build a meaningful, long-term business

We welcome investors who push us on growth, **as long as growth is grounded in evidence, not shortcuts**.

**What We Are Not Optimized For**

ArrestDelta is not being built as a hype-driven or optics-first business.

We are not optimized for:

* Growth strategies that compromise data integrity or signal confidence  
* Expanding scope before the core product is proven at scale  
* Volume-driven GTM approaches that create downstream risk  
* Businesses designed primarily around short-term valuation or narrative momentum

We believe these approaches ultimately cap growth in high-trust markets like ours.

**Our View on Growth**

We are explicitly building ArrestDelta to be a **high-growth company**.

We believe growth will come from:

* Solving a problem enterprises already pay for  
* Delivering materially better outcomes than existing solutions  
* Expanding coverage, customers, and use cases once trust is established  
* Becoming embedded infrastructure rather than a point solution

Our conviction is simple:

**In this market, accuracy scales faster than speed alone.**

**How We Think About Partnership**

We view investors as **long-term partners in decision-making**, not just sources of capital.

We value:

* Direct, honest dialogue  
* Alignment on milestones and capital discipline  
* Willingness to reassess assumptions when evidence changes  
* Respect for operational complexity

In return, we commit to transparency, rigor, and accountability as we scale ArrestDelta.

---

**Closing Thought**

We are ambitious about what ArrestDelta can become.

We are equally disciplined about *how* we get there.

The right investors will recognize that this combination, **high ambition with operational restraint**, is what enables durable, outsized outcomes.
