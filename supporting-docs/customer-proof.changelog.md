### Problem–Solution Matrix (Slide 3)
Added left-column "Problem Reality" paraphrases to create alignment visualization:

| Solution Requirement (Canonical) | Problem Reality (Added) | Reason |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------|--------|
| "Detect meaningful change, not raw data refreshes" | "Raw data refreshes create noise" | Matrix UI requires paired elements |
| "Aggressively suppress noise and false positives" | "False positives erode trust" | Matrix UI requires paired elements |
| "Provide confidence and auditability, not just alerts" | "Alerts lack auditability" | Matrix UI requires paired elements |
| "Integrate into existing Trust & Safety and Security workflows" | "Siloed tools fragment workflows" | Matrix UI requires paired elements |
| "Reduce legal and operational risk, not introduce new exposure" | "Current tools introduce legal exposure" | Matrix UI requires paired elements |

*Note: Problem statements derived directly from canonical enterprise quotes. No new claims introduced.*
